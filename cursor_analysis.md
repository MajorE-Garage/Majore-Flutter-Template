## 5. Translation Automation

The project includes an automated translation process that allows engineers to build with regular strings without worrying about translation, then run a script to handle it. The translation system:

1. Lists out all user-facing string patterns based on the codebase
2. Lists out all technical string patterns based on the codebase
3. Excludes new strings that occur from toMap, fromMap, endpoints, etc. - expected technical implementations
4. Finds strings in Flutter widgets that are user-facing
5. Finds strings based on patterns and exclusions in the codebase
6. Separates found strings into new (haven't been added to translations) and existing (already been added)
7. For strings that are new, cleanly adds them to the base arb (en)
8. Runs flutter gen-l10n to make all strings available in translation
9. Cleanly replaces the strings with their translation using the context extension - `context.translation.wordname`
10. Reports work done in the terminal with appropriate summary

### Edge Cases Handled
- Key names for very long strings
- Strings that contain variables

The translation script is located in the project root and named `translate.py`.
